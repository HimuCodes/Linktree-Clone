# 🚀 Cosmic Linktree: A DIY Space-Themed Link Hub

## 🌌 Overview

Welcome to Cosmic Linktree, a DIY alternative to the popular Linktree service! This project was born out of a desire for customization without the price tag. When Linktree started charging for advanced customization, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a unique, space-themed link hub that's out of this world!

## 🌟 Features

- **Space-Inspired Design**: Immerse visitors in a cosmic experience with a dynamic starry background and nebula-like animations.
- **Animated Profile Picture**: A floating profile picture with a mesmerizing nebula glow effect.
- **Interactive Link Buttons**: Each link button has a captivating hover effect reminiscent of swirling galaxies.
- **Responsive Layout**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Easy to Customize**: Simple HTML structure and CSS file for easy personalization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with advanced animations and pseudo-elements)
- JavaScript (for star animation)

## 📝 How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the page, including your profile information, links, and resume section.

2. **CSS Magic**: The `style.css` file is where the real magic happens:
   - Space background with a panning effect
   - Floating animation for the profile picture as 'profile.jpg'
   - Nebula glow effects using CSS gradients and animations
   - Interactive hover effects for all links

3. **JavaScript Flair**: A simple script creates twinkling stars in the background, adding depth to the space theme.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Modify the `index.html` file with your own information and links
3. Customize the `style.css` file to match your preferred color scheme
4. Replace the profile picture and add your own as profile-picture
5. Deploy to your favorite hosting service (GitHub Pages works great!)

## 💡 Why DIY?

1. **Complete Control**: Tailor every aspect of your link hub to your liking.
2. **No Recurring Costs**: Host it for free on platforms like GitHub Pages.
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Enhance your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
4. **Stand Out**: Create a unique online presence that reflects your personality.
